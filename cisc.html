			<p> CBIT Information Security Club was started with an aim to provide the student community with 
			quality training on the fundamental principles of Information Security. We don't believe in giving 
			away demos , guides and a few tools, and say we are done. We believe that theory and foundation of the 
			concerned subject matter is the top priority. We believe in teaching students the reason why a vulnerability 
			may arise, how to look for common vulnerabilities in software, and also how to develop suitable exploits 
			to demonstrate the Proof Of Concept (POC) attack and then we go about giving some followup on how to
			mitigate those vulnerabilities, essentially sharing the concepts of secure coding.
